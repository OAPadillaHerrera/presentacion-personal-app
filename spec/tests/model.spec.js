/*
  models.spec.js â€“ Unit tests for Activity and Repository classes using Jasmine

  This file tests the main functionalities of the Activity and Repository classes
  defined in the application. These tests validate object structure, data consistency,
  and method behavior to ensure reliability in the application's data management logic.

  Includes:
  - Existence and structure checks for Activity instances
  - Validation of property assignment in Activity objects
  - Initial state and method verification in the Repository class

  These tests are written in Jasmine and help maintain code quality and prevent regressions.
